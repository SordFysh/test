# Cutting Laser Parts

Here are a few tips: 

1. Reserve the laser in advance, it gets busy.
1. Bring scraps so you can take test cuts before initially starting on real cuts.
1. For **Clear Parts Only**, remove the paper on one side so that the top is clear and the bottom is covered.  The reason is that the paper on top will burn and color the sides.  The paper must remain on at the bottom, otherwise the smoke colors the bottom.
1. Make sure clear parts are all the same thickness when we assemble packages.
1. For **Colored Parts**, keep paper on both sides.
